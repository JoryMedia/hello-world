Avast! I'm a recent college graduate in the 3D/CG/Media Arts/Visual Arts/Digital Arts fields. Actually, I have a BFA in Media Arts & Animation. Yes, "Media Arts & Animation" was my official major. That's a major, I had no minor. Don't worry, I'm not obnoxious all the time. Here I come, Game Design!
